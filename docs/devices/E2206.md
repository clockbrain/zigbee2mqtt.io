## Notes

### Pairing
Pair the plug to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button (small hole below the round toggle button) using a needle or a paperclip for about two seconds.
The white light next to the button should flash four times times and then turn off.
After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate.
When connected, the light turns off.
